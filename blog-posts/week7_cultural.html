                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the pros and cons of SQL and NoSQL databases. SQL is a structured query language for relational database management systems. While it can be easy to learn and understand, it does come with certain disadvantages when it comes to interfacing an SQL database. NoSQL databases usually do not have schema, and they come with looser consistency models than traditional relational databases do. While they can be open source and fast for adding new data for simple queries, it comes with some disadvantages in terms of standardization and security.<br><br><a class="link" href="week7_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>

               <h4 class="blog">10th October 2014</h4>

              <section class="blog-content">
                  <div class="website-1">
                    <p>Following are the values that come to my mind when I think of the times I have been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied in life.</p>
                    <p>Accomplishment * Ambition * Close relationships * Confidence * Honesty * Enthusiasm * Personal development * Openness * Competition * Creativity * Knowledge * Wisdom * Challenge * Growth </p>
                    <p>I find confidence as one among the most important assets as I believe it to be the foundation for everthing in life. When I know and appreciate who I am, I feel great about myself and tend to make better choices and better decisions, creating a better life for myself. All this is based on my self confidence. Confidence is just being you and being prepared to face any circumstances that come across your way. Itâ€™s important to be confident, but not overconfident. Have solid respect for your opponent without fear. Believe in yourself without being self-centered or intimidated. Having confidence comes bundled with a lot of benifits like greater self worth, more happiness and enjoyment, freedom from self doubt and freedom from fear and anxiety.</p>
                    <p>On a scale of 1 to 5, I try to live up to the some of the values as:</p>
                    <ul class = "list">
                      <li> Accomplishment - 5</li>
                      <li> Ambition - 5</li>
                      <li> Close relationships - 5</li>
                      <li> Confidence - 5</li>
                      <li> Honesty - 5</li>
                      <li> Enthusiasm - 4</li>
                      <li> Personal Development - 5</li>
                      <li> Openness - 4</li>
                      <li> Competition - 4</li>
                      <li> Creativity - 4</li>
                      <li> Knowledge - 5</li>
                      <li> Wisdom - 4</li>
                      <li> Challenge - 5</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The last piece of advice that someone asked me was how to improve their skills as a programmer. I found the question quite interesting as I was researching around the same question some years back when I started off my career in the software field. I believe that writing lots of programs in various programming languages, learning from the mistakes you do can help to solidify your programming base. Another important aspect considering the general improvement of programming is to broaden your horizon by means of a variety of different programming languages. Learn multiple programming languages of different types and kinds such as object oriented, procedural and functional.</p>
                    <p>Having confidence in you and believing in yourself is the greatest weapon to overcome stereotype threats. Further being honest, kind and respectful to others can also help prevent events like stereotype threat. In terms of feeling down at DBC the best strategy for me is to have faith in me, seek advice from people I am close to, build good friendly relationships with my peers, seek advice on things you are confused about and maintain a healthy state of mind with no room for negative thoughts and feelings.</p>

                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the definition of Recursion in programming languages and its usage. Recursion is a repeated application of a recursive procedure or definition. Recursion can be applied to many types of problems, and is one of the central ideas of computer science and is supported by most computer programming languages.<br><br><a class="link" href="week8_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>
