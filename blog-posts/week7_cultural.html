Some of the remedies include believing strongly in one self, removing constant reminders about their existence and being open to learn new things and keep up with the important trends.<br><br><a class="link" href="week6_cultural_blog.html"> Read More</a></p>

               <h4 class="blog">10th October 2014</h4>
              </div>

                    <p>A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can easily be accessed, managed, and updated. In computing, databases are sometimes classified according to their organizational approach. The most prevalent approach is the relational database, a tabular database in which data is defined so that it can be reorganized and accessed in a number of different ways.Database Management Systems (DBMS) are the higher-level software, working with lower-level application programming interfaces (APIs), that take care of these operations. To help with solving different kind of problems, for decades new kinds of DBMSs have been developed (e.g. Relational, NoSQL, etc.) along with applications implementing them (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc).</p>
                    <p class="java-img"><img src="http://www.attivio.com/SiteMedia/Attivio/images/at_images/general/blog/SQL-v-NoSQL.png" alt="map" width="100%"></p>
                    <p><span>SQL (Structured Query Language)</span><p>
                    <p>SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database. Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc.</p>
                    <p><span>Pros</span></p>
                    <ul class = "list">
                      <li>SQL is widely used for relational databases. It can be used to communicate with the databases and get answers to complex questions in seconds.</li>
                      <li>SQL is very easy and has relatively few commands to learn and understand a SQL query.</li>
                      <li>Programs written in SQL are portable and can be run on local machines, intranet or internet and can be moved from one device to another without any problems.</li>
                      <li>SQL can be used to retrieve large amounts of records from a database quickly and
                      easily.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span>Cons</span></p>
                    <ul class = "list">
                      <li>Requires detailed knowledge of the structure of the database. Interfacing an SQL database is more complex than adding a few lines of code.</li>
                      <li>Common criticisms of SQL include a perceived lack of cross-platform portability between vendors, inappropriate handling of missing data (see Null (SQL)), and unnecessarily complex and occasionally ambiguous language grammar and semantics.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span>NoSQL( Not Only SQL )</span></p>
                    <p>A NoSQL database environment is, simply put, a non-relational and largely distributed database system. NoSQL databases have become the first alternative to relational databases, with scalability, availability, and fault tolerance being key deciding factors. NoSQL data isn't relational, NoSQL databases usually do not have schema, and they come with looser consistency models than traditional relational databases do. Some of the most popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, CouchDB, GemFire, Redis and Cassandra.</p>
                    <p><span>Pros</span></p>
                    <ul class = "list">
                      <li>Mostly open source.</li>
                      <li>There’s no need for complex joins and data can be easily sharded and processed in parallel.</li>
                      <li>Very fast for adding new data and for simple operations/queries.</li>
                      <li>Ability to store complex data types (for document based solutions) in a single item of storage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span>Cons</span></p>
                    <ul class = "list">
                      <li>Absence of standardization. No standard APIs or query language. It means that migration to a solution from different vendor is more costly. Also there are no standard tools</li>
                      <li>Indexing, Security models are just not as sophisticated as they are with classical relational databases. And because most of it is coming from the open source community the support is not as good as it is for relational databases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><span>Conclusion</span></p>
                    <p>SQL and NoSQL have been great inventions over time in the area of data management and have been used to keep data storage and retrieval optimized and smooth. It’s still hard to criticize one and completely go with the other option. Both technologies are best in what they do and it is up to a developer to put them to better use depending on the business situations and needs.</p>
