                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the definition of Recursion in programming languages and its usage. Recursion is a repeated application of a recursive procedure or definition. Recursion can be applied to many types of problems, and is one of the central ideas of computer science and is supported by most computer programming languages.<br><br><a class="link" href="week8_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>

                    <p class="java-img"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2ylImw4G2g4/Tfs_FpPbAxI/AAAAAAAAAQI/K1vDnBYkShw/s1600/shameu.jpg" alt="map" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>Like most of us, I always prefer to avoid conflict as much as possible. I believe avoiding conflict is an appropriate choice, depending on the circumstances. In some cases, it may turn effective, but in some others it may also contribute to the problem and prevent it from being resolved. I usually deal with conflict by changing the subject or putting off a discussion untill later.</p>
                    <p>Thinking back, I remember having a conflict with one of my co-workers because of some miscommunication and the co-worker failing to convey the right information to me. As a result I had to overstretch myself to complete the assigned task before the deadline. I was a little distured at that time, but with time and experience, I learnt to accept conflict as a natural growth process and deal with it in a constructive fashion. Developing skills to get a better handle on your emotional strengths and weaknesses through emotional intelligence plays a vital role in nurturing great relationships.</p>
                    <p>I learnt to refrain from taking a rushed decision and allow time to obtain more information or support. Well planned and prepared decisions are usually the best decisions of dealing conflict. When there is no opportunity to constructively address the concern - attempts to deal with the problem will likely result in futility and may make matters worse. It may not be the right time or place.</p>
                    <p><span>Conclution</span></p>
                    <p>Having the skills and a good understanding of the nature of the conflict can help to deal with it efficiently and confidently. As professionals our role is to bring the best knowledge and strategies to issues to address them in a productive, respectful and positive matter.</p>
