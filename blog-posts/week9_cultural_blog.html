                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have presented my experiences about dealing with conflict and what I learnt from that experience. Having the skills and a good understanding of the nature of the conflict can help to deal with it efficiently and confidently. As professionals our role is to bring the best knowledge and strategies to issues to address them in a productive, respectful and positive matter.<br><br><a class="link" href="week8_cultural_blog.html"> Read More</a></p>

                    <p class="java-img"><img src="http://josephjpote.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/asking-the-right-question-masterisolatedimages.jpg" alt="map" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>I believe asking the right questions is the key to make sure you have the right information you need in your decision making rule. Good questions create a culture of inquiry and curiosity and help to discover the bright spots in the field of education. Positive framed questions can lead to positive results.</p>
                    <p>As far as asking questions is concerned, I always try to research the topic and get it resolved using the google search and many other welknown online support available. I generally found quora and stackoverflow.com as a good source of knowledge. There have been very few times where I posted questions on quora and have managed to get wonderful elaborative responses. </p>
                    <p>Further, giving a clear and meaningful answer to the question is also equally important. I have been playing an active role in answering questions that my fellow cohortmates had, on google plus. There have been times when I went back and reframed my solution to help people understand it better. </p>
                    <p>According to me, the best strategy behind asking the right meaningful questions, is to first be clear about the question and frame it in a nice sensible way with some examples including what exactly is the part you are unsure of. Also trying to be as much specific as possible and including snippets of the exact error messages may further help to diagnose the problem and provide meaninful and to the point suggesstions.</p>
