                      <p><span>Quora</span><br><br>Quora is a great social and most exciting academic website out there. It has tons of great useful content giving an opportunity to learn new things and find interesting perspectives in life.  What I like about it is the opportunity it gives you to ask questions, create new topics and get good feedback.  Users vote answers and the best answers get pushed to the top of the queue. This gives you a chance to find the most optimum solution to your questions within seconds.  For every question, you can find a good amount of carefully elaborated answers by professionals. It also allows you to submit your post to many communities and also see your statistics as to how many people have seen your post. It is an amazing resource that fills the information gap that is not provided by sites like Wikipedia. In addition, Quora Weekly Digest also has questions from other users that are specific to user’s interests.</p><br>

                      <p><span>Pandora Radio</span><br><br>Pandora has an incredible design and user experience with solid song recommendations and customization options. The recent addition of the Music Genome Project allows you to key in the name of an artist or song and populate upto 100 unique stations. In addition the  “Buy” and “Share” icons lets you purchase the track from Amazon or iTunes or share it with your friends on Facebook or Twitter. It also has a music feed where you can see a glimpse of what your Pandora loving friends are listening to. Recently the limitations on the amount of music you can listen to has been removed allowing users to listen to unlimited music. Also the push feature introduced in the Android App notifies you if a new music from your favorite artists becomes available. Pandora makes all the features available on a tablet wherein you can add variety to your stations, view your thumb history and see track lyrics. Above all, I believe the site is well organized, entertaining and a sleek web design.</p><br>

                      <p><span>Netflix</span><br><br>Netflix is one of my favorite video streaming service with an attractive interface and a great value with no hidden extras.  Its predictive search capability starts to filter out titles as you type in and gives you back the best results without having to look for stuff in the gallery. The look of the Netflix menus is quite appealing with colorful DVD covers for all the films and TV shows available. Another great user friendly feature of Netflix is the way it tracks any viewing progress you may have made with a particular video. This enables users to resume the video even if they switch devices without having to play it from the beginning.</p>
