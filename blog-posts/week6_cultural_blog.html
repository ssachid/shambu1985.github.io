                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the differences between various variable scopes in Ruby. Variables are essentially a way to store a value and assign a name to that value for reference purposes. Variable scope defines where in a program a variable is accessible. Each variable type is declared by using a special character at the start of the variable name.Ruby has 5 different types of variable scope: local, global, instance, class and class instance variables. <br><br><a class="link" href="week6_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>

                  <div class="website-1">
                    <p>Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as a self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's social group (Steele & Aronson, 1995).</p>
                    <p class="java-img"><img src="../imgs/stereotype.png" alt="map" width="100%"></p>
                    <p>Stereotype threat is a self-confirming belief that one may be evaluated based on a negative stereotype. Because of this threat, people who get reminded of their negative stereotypes about their race or gender perform worse in the tests than usual by underestimating their true ability. Although psychologists such as Steele concede that test-score gaps probably can't be totally attributed to stereotype threat, the threat appears to be sufficiently influential to be heeded by teachers, students, researchers, policymakers and parents.</p>
                    <p>Stereotype threat effects have been shown with a wide range of social groups and stereotypes including women in math, men compared with women on social sensitivity, whites compared with Asian men in mathematics. These factors play a major role in one’s stereotype vulnerability. The consequences of these include performance degradation in academic and non-academic fields resulting from less concentration on a task.</p>
                    <p>I personally did not experience any stereotype threat so far as I am blessed to have my parents, teachers and mentors always encouraging my performance and interest in science, technology, engineering, and math fields and giving me the sprit to face any challenges that come across my way. But I have seen negative stereotypes about women’s math abilities being transmitted to many of my female colleagues by their parents and teachers, ultimately undermining their interest and performance in various domains.</p>
                    <p>As a remedy to beat stereotype threat, inculcating certain changes can stop the effects to a great extent.  Remedies should be taken to remove constant reminders about the existence of these stereotype threats. For example declaring before the test starts that the test is gender fair and non-diagnostic can have a dramatic effect in the performance of students. If girls and women encounter fewer situations in which they experience stereotype threat, their increasing performance may one day break the ugly cycle of the stereotype leading to poor performance and the poor performance in turn feeding the stereotype.</p>
                    <p>Technology has become a critical element of almost every industry. Being open to learning new things and availing every opportunity to ask and get more comfortable with it and keep up with the important trends can help, not to stereotype yourself to a great extent.</p>
                    <p>Another major remedy to beat stereotype is to be strong enough to put these stereotype threats out of one’s mind, have confidence in self, believe in one’s own individual abilities and rise above all the fear of these stereotype treats can help bring forward their true abilities.</p>

                     <p class="side-blog">In this blog I have explored the pros and cons of SQL and NoSQL databases. SQL is a structured query language for relational database management systems. While it can be easy to learn and understand, it does come with certain disadvantages when it comes to interfacing an SQL database. NoSQL databases usually do not have schema, and they come with looser consistency models than traditional relational databases do. While they can be open source and fast for adding new data for simple queries, it comes with some disadvantages in terms of standardization and security.<br><br><a class="link" href="week7_technical.html"> Read More</a></p>
